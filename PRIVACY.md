## 1. Personal Information Collection and Use

We may receive, indirectly via app store infrastructure rather than
directly from the app itself, technical information about your device,
for example, its IP address or operating system through system crash
dumps or reports.

## 2. Personal Information Sharing

*Open HLX* and *Open HLX Installer* do not directly collect any personal
information. Neither do we share any personal information, received
indirectly.

## 3. Social Logins

*Open HLX* and *Open HLX Installer* do not use any social login
functionality.

## 4. In-app Purchase Information

*Open HLX* and *Open HLX Installer* do not process any in-app purchase
information.

## 5. Children's Personal Information

Users of *Open HLX* and *Open HLX Installer* must be at least 13 years
old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If
we learn that we have collected personal information from a child, we
will take all reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. If you
become aware that a child has provided personal information to us,
please contact us at the contact information [below](#contact-us).

## 6. How Long We Keep Your Personal Information

*Open HLX* and *Open HLX Installer* do not directly collect any personal
information. Crash dumps or reports received indirectly from app store
infrastructure will be kept for as long as necessary to resolve related
issues with the app implementation and its related source code.

## 7. How We Protect Your Personal Information

We use encryption to protect personal information stored and transmitted
online. Only personnel who need the personal information to perform a
specific function have access to such. The computers and servers on
which we store personal information are kept in a secure environment.

## 8. Policy Changes

When we make material changes to this privacy policy, for example, due
to app updates or changes in the law, we will post the updated policy
here. The policy will always apply in the version at the time of your
use of *Open HLX* and *Open HLX Installer* even if you downloaded *Open
HLX* and *Open HLX Installer* at a time when a previous policy version
was applicable.
